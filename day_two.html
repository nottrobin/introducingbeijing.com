          <h1>Day Two</h1>
          <h2>Visit the Forbidden City, the JingShan Park, the Houhai and the Beijing Hutongs</h2>
          <p>We could start with the <a href="http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/issues/forbidden_city.htm" title="more information about the Forbidden City" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Forbidden City</a>. The earlier the better as it can get quite crowded. It will probably be near to where you're staying so 9am would be a good time to start.</p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/issues/forbidden_city.htm" title="more information about the Forbidden City" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Forbidden City</a> has several museums inside, as well as being quite extensive. Two and a half hours would probably be sufficient to see the place.</p>
          <p>Then we can climb the hill behind the city - <a href="http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/beijing/jingshan.htm" title="information about JingShan Park" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">JingShan Park</a> - from which you get good views over the city.</p>
          <p>We could then lunch at <a href="http://www.gluckman.com/BeijingHouHaiLake.html" title="information about the Houhai" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Houhai</a>, which has restaurants beside a beautiful lake.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon, you can take a rickshaw ride through the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-01/14/content_298860.htm" title="information about the Beijing Hutongs" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Hutongs</a> if you like.</p>
          <p>In the evening you may wish to go to a famous duck restaurant which we can organize for you.</p>
          <p>So, if you think we could help you please <a href="contact.html"><strong>get in touch</strong></a>.</p>
