          <h1>A friendly introduction to Beijing</h1>
          <h2>Let us introduce you to one of the  most beautiful cities in the world</h2>
          <p>Beijing is a wonderful place to spend a week or two. It has long history, beautiful surroundings and friendly people. Imagine walking along the <a href="http://www.beijingtrip.com/attractions/greatwall/" title="information about the Great Wall in Beijing" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Great Wall</a>, seeing the <a href="day_two.html">Forbidden City</a>, relaxing in the <a href="day_one.html">largest garden in Asia</a>, walking the <a href="day_three.html">'Fragrant Hills'</a> and then seeing <a href="day_one.html">acrobatics</a>, the <a href="day_one.html">Beijing Opera</a> or attending a Mongolian wedding feast. All of this is surprisingly easy and inexpensive to do if you know how. But it can be a challenge for those who don't speak Chinese or know their way around.</p>
          <p>So if you would like a memorable holiday in Beijing we can help you.</p>
          <p>We are Beijing locals who specialise in looking after visitors to our lovely city. We and our friends all speak English, and we have looked after many families and individuals from all over the world during the last few years. Put your holiday in our hands, and we'll organise everything for you.</p>
          <p>So let us:</p>
