          <h1>Day Three</h1>
          <h2>Visit the Lama Temple and the Fragrant Hills</h2>
          <p>We could start the day at about 9am and head for the <a href="http://www.beijingservice.com/lamatemple.htm" title="more information on the Lama Temple" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Lama temple</a> (Yonghegong), one of the finest temples in Beijing.</p>
          <p>From there we could move on to the <a href="http://www.beijingservice.com/attractions/fragranthill.htm" title="more information on the Fragrant Hills" onclick="return generalMethods.openNew(this.href,800,600)">Fragrant Hills</a> which are about an hour away. They are in the mountains above Beijing - a beautiful area of gardens and small temples in the woods. There is a chair lift to spare you from some of the climbing.</p>
          <p>In the evening you may wish to go to another show, or possibly a concert (if you say what type of music you like, We could research what is on). Or we could take you to an area of bars with music if you like. Let us know.</p>
          <p>We would be happy to accompany you on each day. We charge RM600 (US$75) per day, inclusive of all organization, sourcing tickets etc.</p>
          <p>As for transport, the cheapest is to take one or more standard Beijing taxis. That might only cost around RM200 even for the longer trips. Alternatively we can source a car and driver which might cost RM4-500 per day.</p>
          <p>You would pay for entrance fees, including for one of us, where necessary. They are not very expensive - usually RM10-50 or so. Forbidden City is more - RM80 per person.</p>
          <p>If you think we could help you please <a href="contact.html"><strong>get in touch</strong></a>.</p>
